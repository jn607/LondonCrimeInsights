"Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force will be 1,400 short at the end of March 2024, and 2,650 short by March 2025 at current application and recruitment levels.
Under the national programme to replace 20,000 police officer jobs cut during austerity measures from 2010, the Home Office has allocated funding for the Met to employ 35,415 full-time equivalent officers, yet application rates are still declining. The Met are trying to pull 3,000 officers currently doing staff jobs that could be done by civilians over the next three years."

It is clear that there is a shortfall in police officer numbers in London. Such essential job roles must be used effectively. This can be done by efficiently allocating police resource and officers to boroughs with greater crime rate. Sending in officers with expertise in specific crimes, to those areas which those crimes most frequently occur. 

In this project I will be performing exploratory analysis and predicitive modelling to provide insights which may provide some value into this, even if just to inform the public of safety levels across the boroughs.
